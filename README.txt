\f0\fs24 \cf0 README.txt file for BetterGPT 2 Version 0.1\
\
Current path (to be changed): /Users/ronshairubin/ML_API/Python_Code/ML/my_first_flask_project/\
\
## Project Specifications\
\
Create a new version of GPT that takes two answers to the same prompt, evaluates them, and uses the better answer. It should also ask what the parameter settings are for each AI (AI1 and AI2) that is answering, and it should maintain a memory of the dialog so that the user can continue the chat naturally. Finally, it should create an output document with all the answers, the evaluation scores for each criterion given.\
\
## Prerequisites\
\
- Python 3.8 or higher\
- Conda package manager\
\
## Setup Instructions\
\
### Using the Same Environment\
\
If you want both the original and backup projects to use the same virtual environment (`vsc_env`):\
\
1. **Activate the Environment:**\
   ```bash\
   conda activate vsc_env\
   ```\
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\
   ```bash\
   cd /path/to/my_first_flask_project_version_0.1\
   ```\
3. **Install Dependencies:**\
   If the dependencies are not already installed in the environment, run:\
   ```bash\
   pip install -r requirements.txt\
   ```\
\
### Using Separate Environments\
\
If you prefer to use a separate virtual environment for the backup project:\
\
1. **Create a New Environment:**\
   ```bash\
   conda create --name vsc_env_version_0.1 python=3.8\
   conda activate vsc_env_version_0.1\
   ```\
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\
   ```bash\
   cd /path/to/my_first_flask_project_version_0.1\
   ```\
3. **Install Dependencies:**\
   ```bash\
   pip install -r requirements.txt\
   ```\
\
## Running the Project\
\
1. **Activate the Environment:**\
   - For the same environment:\
     ```bash\
     conda activate vsc_env\
     ```\
   - For the separate environment:\
     ```bash\
     conda activate vsc_env_version_0.1\
     ```\
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\
   ```bash\
   cd /path/to/my_first_flask_project_version_0.1\
   ```\
3. **Run the Application:**\
   ```bash\
   python app.py\
   ```\
4. **Access the Application:**\
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to interact with the application.\
\
## Additional Notes\
\
- Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly set up with your OpenAI API key:\
  ```\
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key\
  ```\
- The `Decision.txt` file will be generated in the `/path/to/my_first_flask_project_version_0.1` directory with details about the AI responses and evaluations.\
- To stop the application, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal.\

\
## Current Functionality vs. Intended Functionality\
\
### What the Project Does\
\
1. **Initializes Flask Application:**\
   - The Flask application is set up with routes for serving the web interface and handling API requests.\
2. **Handles AI Responses:**\
   - Receives a prompt and generates two responses using the OpenAI API.\
   - Evaluates the two responses based on predefined criteria.\
3. **Maintains Conversation History:**\
   - Keeps track of the conversation history to provide context for subsequent responses.\
4. **Saves Output to File:**\
   - Writes the AI responses, evaluations, and better response to a file (`Decision.txt`).\
\
### What the Project Doesn't Do (Issues)\
\
1. **Evaluation Criteria:**\
   - The evaluation criteria are implemented but not explicitly scoring each criterion in the `Decision.txt` file.\
2. **Web Interface Interaction:**\
   - The web interface does not dynamically update the conversation or maintain a continuous chat flow as intended.\
   - Shift-Enter functionality for sending messages and enlarging the input box is not fully implemented.\
3. **File Handling:**\
   - The output file handling needs improvement to ensure proper logging of responses and evaluations.\
4. **Parameter Settings:**\
   - The project does not prompt for parameter settings for AI1 and AI2 as specified.\
5. **Error Handling:**\
   - Error handling is basic and needs improvement to capture and log detailed error messages.\
6. **Opening Web Browser:**\
   - The project does not automatically open a new tab in Chrome when the application starts.\
\
## Summary\
\
This project sets up a basic Flask application to interact with the OpenAI API, generate AI responses, and evaluate them. However, it requires further development to meet all the specified requirements, including dynamic web interface updates, detailed evaluation criteria, and comprehensive error handling.\
